# PythonStuff
This is a compilation of all my notable python projects/assignments from my coursework


The first folder titled "DistanceConverter" contains a file with python code for a distance converter that works in both directions


The second folder titled "MinaTawfik_omis30_project_s2019" contains my final project from my python course. There is another folder within this file further detailing what the program is and how it works


The third folder titled "MontyHall" contains three different programs reflecting the Monty Hall game show problem. I would reccomend googling what this game is to further understand the program and code involded. 
 - "montyhallpt1.py" is the most simple version of the program which uses mostly if else statements to run the program.    
  
 - "montyhallpt2.py" uses mostly while loops instead of if else statements to run the program, and thus allow the end user to     play the game. 
 
 - "montyhallpt3.py" further advances the program that allows the user to run it as a simulation for as many times as he/she       wants. It then prints the win/loss rate depending on the player's strategy.
